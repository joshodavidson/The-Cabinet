# Project Log

### Design Doc #2 and App Development
---
This week, the team turned in our rough draft for design document #2. The team will be meeting this Friday to really focus on the development effort. We have made good progress on the app over the past week. After discussion, the team chose to change our programming language to swift and focus on the iOS funcitonality of the application first. Given the team's experience, Swift turned out to be the better choice for the project. A TestFlight has been established for our application, so the team can download and test the application on our own devices as we work on it.

### Design Doc #2 and Possible Changes
---
The team's focus this week will be finishing design document #2. We will be meeting later this week in order to discuss and finish the document. Also, after discussion, the team is considering switching the programming language we use for the project from C# to Swift. Some team members have more experience with Swift, and it may be better for the project in the end. There is still more discussion to be had on this topic, but it is looking probable.

### First Update
---
Since this is our first project log item, the team wants to use this as a chance to catch our readers up on the work the team has done so far this semester. The first large item our team has completed would the draft for the Software Requirements Specification Document. The team put in many hours and performed research in order to complete the document. Also, our team has had the chance to meet once with the McKinley team so far this semester. During our meeting, the team was able to obtain information about the museum and learn about the requirements for the application. Our team plans to continue to communicate with museum staff throughout the semester. Finally, the team's focus for the coming week will be to make progress on the Preliminary Product Schedule and the Initial Press Release.
